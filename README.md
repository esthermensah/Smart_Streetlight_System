This project contains files for my Undergraduate Capston Project where I developed a Smart Streetlight monitoring System. 
I built a complete prototype of the system t that automated the control of streetlights with an algorithm that responded to distance and weather. 
The project can potentially increase energy conservation by 35% and allows real-time fault detection and monitoring on an interactive dashboard
Embedded technology and object-oriented programming using C was used for programming the microcontroller and determining system control. Other technologies used were LoRa communication, SolidWorks, Edge computing  
AdminLTE template was edited for creation of the dashboard.
An explanatory video of the entire system can be accessed here :
