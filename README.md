This project contains files for my Undergraduate Capstone Project where I developed a Smart Streetlight monitoring System. 

I built a complete prototype of the system  that automated the control of streetlights with an algorithm that responded to distance, weather and light intensity. 

The project can potentially increase energy conservation by 25% and allows real-time fault detection and monitoring on an interactive dashboard.

Embedded technology and object-oriented programming using C was used for programming the microcontroller and determining system control. Other technologies used were LoRa communication, SolidWorks, Edge computing.

AdminLTE template was edited for creation of the dashboard.

An explanatory video of the entire system can be accessed here : https://github.com/esthermensah/Smart_Streetlight_System/blob/main/Smart%20Streetlight%20video%20.m4v
